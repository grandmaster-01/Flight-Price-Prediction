# Flight Price Prediction

## 📋 Project Overview
This project aims to predict flight ticket prices using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various factors such as airline, departure time, arrival time, duration, number of stops, and route information, the model helps travelers make informed decisions about when to book their flights for the best prices.

## 🎯 Objective
The main objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate flight prices based on historical data and various flight attributes, enabling users to:
- Plan their travel budget effectively
- Identify the best time to book flights
- Understand price trends across different routes and airlines

## ✨ Key Features
- Predicts flight prices based on multiple input features
- Analyzes the impact of different factors on flight pricing
- Provides insights into airline pricing patterns
- Helps optimize booking decisions

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and model building
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset typically includes features such as:
- **Airline**: Name of the airline company
- **Date of Journey**: Date of the flight
- **Source**: Departure city
- **Destination**: Arrival city
- **Route**: Flight route taken
- **Departure Time**: Time of departure
- **Arrival Time**: Time of arrival
- **Duration**: Total flight duration
- **Total Stops**: Number of stops between source and destination
- **Additional Info**: Extra information about the flight
- **Price**: Target variable (flight ticket price)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/grandmaster-01/Flight-Price-Prediction.git
cd Flight-Price-Prediction
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze patterns and relationships in the data
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create relevant features for the model
4. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R²
6. **Prediction**: Make predictions on new flight data

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
Common algorithms used for flight price prediction:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Neural Networks

## 📈 Model Performance
The model's performance is evaluated using:
- **R² Score**: Measures how well the model explains variance
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Standard deviation of prediction errors
